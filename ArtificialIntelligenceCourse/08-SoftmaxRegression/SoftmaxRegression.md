#  Softmax Regression - Artificial Intelligence Course
8th lesson of the Artificial Intelligence Crash Course for all<BR/>
By Diogo Cortiz (TIDD/PUC-SP)<BR/>

- Theoretical class<BR/>

This video shows the intuition and mathematics involved in Softmax Regression, also called Multinomial Logistic Regression, a generalization of Logistic Regression to work with more than two classes in Machine Learning. 
This video also shows the Softmax cost function, in addition to its implementation in Pytorch.
