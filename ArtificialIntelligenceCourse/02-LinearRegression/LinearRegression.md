# Linear Regression- Artificial Intelligence Course
2nd lesson of the Artificial Intelligence Crash Course for all<BR/>
By Diogo Cortiz (TIDD/PUC-SP)<BR/>
Theorical class about Linear Regression.<BR/>
Hands-on:<BR/>
In this lesson, we train a linear regression model to predict continuous values.<BR/>

## Theory
- categoric (discret) values: features, classes/labels  CLASSIFICATION
- numeric values(cintinuos): dependent and independent variables REGRESSION 

FEATURE: input data is != label
CLASSES: possible values to the lables

Anscombe's quartet
Description
DescriptionAnscombe's quartet comprises four data sets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics, yet have very different distributions and appear very different when graphed. Each dataset consists of eleven points. (Wikipedia)

## Code
- Analyzes two fictitious datasets to learning (engine: numeric dataset and hospital: discret).
