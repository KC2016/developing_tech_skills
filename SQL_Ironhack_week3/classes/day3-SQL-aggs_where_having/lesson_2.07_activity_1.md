# 2.07 Activity 1

Keep working on the `bank` database.

1. In the `loan` table (which is part of the `bank` database), there's column status A, B, C, and D. Using the `case` statement we will create a new column with the values there with a brief description:

    - 'A' : 'Good - Contract Finished'
    - 'B' : 'Defaulter - Contract Finished'
    - 'C' : 'Good - Contract Running'
    - 'D' : 'In Debt - Contract Running'


2. In the lesson, we talked about the reasons why normalization is critical in a database design. One of the reasons we talked about was data anomalies. We will discuss data anomalies in more detail in the next lesson. Here are a couple of resources that you can use to read more about data anomalies. Go through these links and then we will have a discussion in class:
